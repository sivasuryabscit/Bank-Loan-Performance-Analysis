Bank Loan Performance Analysis using Power  BI
## Problem Statement:
In today's data-driven world, understanding how borrower details and loan
characteristics impact loan performance is very important for banking institutions. This
project seeks to delve deep into a lending loan dataset to uncover the relationship
between borrower behavior (such as employment length, income, and debt-to-income
ratio) and loan characteristics (including amount, term, and interest rate) to unearth
critical insights into loan performance metrics. By examining patterns in loan statuses
such as fully paid, charged off, or late payments, this analysis aims to empower banking
institutions with actionable insights to optimize loan lending strategies, mitigate credit
risk, and enhance overall portfolio performance.
